# Plivo StatusPage App

This project is a full-stack application with a clear separation of concerns between the server-side REST API and the client-side frontend code.

## Folders

- **server:** Contains the code for the REST API. This is where you'll find logic for managing the applications, services, indicents, and status.
- **client:** Houses the frontend code. This contains the public facing page for displaying the application, incidents and status of services.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.

**Server Setup:**

1. Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd server`
2. Install project dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Start the server using the command: `pnpm dev`

**Client Setup:**

1. Navigate to the `client` directory: `cd client`
2. Install project dependencies (if applicable): `npm install`
3. Start the development server (if applicable) using thre command: `npm start`
